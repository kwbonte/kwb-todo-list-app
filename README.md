# KwbTodoListApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Expected Results

A project displaying todo lists at the top of the screen with a centered add new form, and local storage saved results bubbling down. Each option have a check mark that will strike through a task and a delete x in red that removes the todo from the list.

## Potential Improvements

- Add in a star for highest priority options
- Add in a date time
